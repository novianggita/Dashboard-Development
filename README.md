# Dashboard-Development

**What is the importance of charts and dashboard?**
Let's consider the following data presentation.

How long will it take for individuals to comprehend the summary of the data? For example, which products are the best-sellers? It will likely take some time, especially for those who are apprehensive about numbers. While there is nothing inherently wrong with summaries, not everyone will be interested or enthusiastic about understanding the data. This is particularly true when presenting data to others such as superiors, clients, or stakeholders, who might not even glance at it.

So, what is the solution? We need a touch of artistry to make the data visually appealing. We must first capture visual interest to ensure they engage with our data.

Now, consider the following image.

It's slightly more interesting and concise, isn't it? There are fewer numbers, but more images and colors, making it visually more attractive. This allows us to narrate the data effectively. People can quickly grasp our data because it is summarized visually. Since not everyone has ample time to understand data, a practical and quick approach is necessary. Thus, dashboards are incredibly important.

Today, many tools can be used to create dashboards, such as Power BI, Tableau, Looker, and even programming languages like Python and R can be utilized to create simple charts. Here are some examples of how thousands of rows of data can be understood in minutes (or even seconds) with a single dashboard view.
