## Objective Analysis
To review the company’s sales performance and profits over the past six years. This analysis is conducted to evaluate the current sales and marketing strategies and to develop future plans.

## Business Questions
1. What are the overall trends in the number of customers, sales, and profits over the past six years?
2. Which products generate the highest profits and achieve the highest sales? Are these results proportional (i.e., does the best-selling product also yield the highest profit)?
3. Where is the majority of the customer base located, and how does this relate to the company’s profit?
4. Analyze the top customers based on the highest spending on product purchases.

## Insights (Based on Business Questions)
1. Overall, the sales performance shows a declining trend until the end of 2021.
   - The number of customers making transactions over the past six years has remained stagnant. Although there was consistent growth until 2019, a continuous decline followed until the end of 2021. This trend has affected both sales volume and company profits.
   - Total sales had been increasing over the six-year period; however, in the last two years, total sales have continuously decreased.
   - In line with the decrease in sales, the company’s profits have also declined, especially in the last two years. In 2021, profits fell by more than 50% compared to 2016.
2. Here are some summaries that can be obtained:
   - Accessories products have become the best-selling items. However, the highest profits come from the Bikes category. This is because the selling price of Bikes is significantly higher than that of other product types.
   - Upon further examination, a significant increase in total sales occurred in 2018, when product diversification began. Not only did the company focus on Bikes, but it also started to develop complementary products such as accessories and clothing. This indicates that implementing product innovation is one of the factors that should be considered to boost future sales.
   - As we know, a significant decline in both sales and profits began in 2020. Further analysis shows that nearly all sub-product categories experienced a decline in sales during that year.
3. The United States is the country with the highest number of customer transactions. However, this does not align with the profit findings, as Australia—ranked second in terms of customer transactions—is the country contributing the highest profit. Similarly, Canada, which ranks third, has profit levels that are significantly lower than those of the countries ranked afterward. This indicates that the country with the most customer transactions is not necessarily the one contributing the highest profit. In other words, each country has its distinct customer characteristics based on the products they prefer (both in terms of type and price).
4. All of the top 10 customers with the highest spending are from France, with most of them spending in excess of 180 million over the past six years.

## Action Plan (Recommendation)
1. Increase customer transaction activity by offering additional products through recommendation features and marketing messages.
2. Increase the number of customers by expanding the market to other cities or countries.
3. Conduct further analysis on why some customers rarely transact.
4. Evaluate and, if necessary, reduce products with the lowest sales.
5. Product innovation in the form of accessories and clothing has proven successful in increasing sales. In the future, this strategy can be applied to maintain customer interest. Considering that the products with the highest sales and profits are durable goods (bikes), further product innovations will be needed each year to sustain customer interest. Customer backgrounds such as gender, age, country/city of origin, and the most frequently purchased product categories can be used to segment customers so that product innovations are well-targeted.
6. Focus on customer shopping behavior in each country. Conduct market segmentation analysis to understand customer preferences based on their country. The results of this analysis can serve as a guideline for targeted product innovations that meet market needs.
7. Provide rewards (ex. discounts) for customers with the highest total spending.
8. Offer top-selling products to customers with the lowest purchases or spending by analyzing past transaction data to understand their preferences and offering similar products.
